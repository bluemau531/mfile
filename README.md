This is my Java Object Oriented Programming Practice Project. 
I am learning more about how to create objects and classes, 
and ultimately how to use these together and separately.

The purpose of this project is to create a Monopoly game.

Why Monopoly?
    I Love the game and would like to create my own spin on the game. Adding unique features for players to play with others or by themselves!
    In addition, Monopoly is a complicated game that requires a small banking system, management of properties, and more. I believe with the complexity of the board game
    will be a good way for me to practice a hands on project that tackles: Object Oriented Programming, A.I (For the Single Player), and... I'm still trying to figure out
    the rest haha!
